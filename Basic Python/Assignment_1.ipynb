    "Data types are classified or categorization of data items. It represents the kind of values that tells what opeartions can be performed on a particular data. Since everything is an object in Python programming, data types are actually classes and variables are instance(object) of these classes.\n",

    "Integer : This is represented by int class. It contains positive or negative whole numbers(without fraction or decimal). In\n",

    "List    : List are just like arrays, declared in othet languages which is a ordered collection of data. It is very flexible \n",
